our game, blind camper, is about a blind camper whos lost in the woods and needs to get back to their campsite

there are sound aspects. when the player walks on gravel theyre on the right path and the grass is the wrong path

if the camper strays too far from the path, they can run into bears and they can die if they dont move away from it

the end goal of the game is to find the cane and to get back to the campsite.
